This is an experimental port of thinjvm to the ARM platform.
The target board is a Blueboard LPC2148. Some of the code also
addresses a gameduino board, using SPI - this is optional.
First build thinj and friends, then build this using build.sh.
Note that 'alltests.c' is the output from thinj copied into this project.
